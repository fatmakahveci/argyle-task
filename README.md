  ```bash
  curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
  ```

  Add `$HOME/.local/bin` to your `$PATH`.

  ```bash
  poetry --version # check if installed
  poetry self update # update
  ```

```bash
# start a new python project
poetry new argyle-task

# configure poetry to create virtual environments inside the project's root directory
poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true

# specify the python version for the local directory using pyenv
pyenv local 3.10.9

# add libraries
poetry add beautifulsoup4 Celery httpx

# activate the virtual environment
poetry shell

## deactivate the virtual environment
# deactivate # for later use

# run your script
poetry run python <python_file>.py

# get the latest versions of the dependencies
